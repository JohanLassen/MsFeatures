Title: Functionality for Mass Spectrometry Features 
Version: 0.0.1
Description: The MsFeature package defines functionality for Mass Spectrometry
    features. This includes functions to group (LC-MS) features based on some
    of their properties, such as retention time (coeluting features), or
    correlation of signals across samples.
